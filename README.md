A powerful VS Code extension that enables seamless synchronization of settings, keybindings, and extensions across VS Code and its forks (like Cursor) using local storage.

## Features

- <samp><b>Cross-IDE Sync</b></samp>: Synchronize settings, keybindings, and extensions between VS Code and its forks
- <samp><b>Local Storage</b></samp>: Uses `~/.crosside-sync` directory for shared storage with full user control
- <samp><b>Auto & Manual Sync</b></samp>: Automatic sync on startup with manual commands for settings, keybindings, and extensions
- <samp><b>Smart Conflict Resolution</b></samp>: Compares modification times to preserve your latest changes
- <samp><b>Extension Management</b></samp>: Sync extensions with filtering options to exclude specific ones

## Supported Editors

- VS Code
- Cursor
- Other VS Code-based editors (untested)

## Why ?

Many developers use multiple VS Code-based editors simultaneously - VS Code for general development, Cursor for AI-assisted coding, and other forks for specific workflows. Managing consistent settings, keybindings, and extensions across these different environments can be time-consuming and error-prone.

Crosside Sync solves this problem by providing a unified synchronization system that works across all VS Code-based editors. Whether you're switching between VS Code and Cursor, or using multiple machines with different VS Code forks, your development environment stays consistent.
